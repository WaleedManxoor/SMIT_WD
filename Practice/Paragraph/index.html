    <p>A paragraph consists of one or more sentences 
        that form a self-contained unit of discourse. The 
        start of a paragraph is indicated by a new 
        line.</p>
       <p>Text is easier to understand when it is split up 
        into units of text. For example, a book may have 
        chapters. Chapters can have subheadings. Under 
        each heading there will be one or more 
        paragraphs.</p>
